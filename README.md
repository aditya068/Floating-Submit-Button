# Floating-Submit-Button
The Floating Submit Button is a user interface element designed to enhance the user experience in web forms by providing a convenient and accessible way to submit form data. This button "floats" above the content of the form, remaining visible even as the user scrolls through lengthy forms, ensuring easy access to the submission action.
